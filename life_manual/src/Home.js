        <p>A life manual as defined here is a book one writes about themselves that talks about what is important. We spend so much time being influenced by others but what if we could be influenced by ourselves?</p>
        <p>The purpose of this app is to guide users on how to structure a life manual, and to inspire and generate content.</p>
        <p>Note: each of these sections could be an App in itself. Potential for expansion.</p>
